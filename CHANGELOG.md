# Changelog

Notable changes to dolphindes. Versions follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org);
while we're pre-1.0, the public API may still change between minor releases.

## [0.2.2] — 2026-07-29

Performance. Dual solves are 2.4–7.5x faster with identical results, and the gains
grow with the number of constraints: an LDOS bound on a 2500-pixel design region takes
1.9 s instead of 14.0 s with 128 constraints, 0.77 s instead of 3.7 s with 32, and GCD
runs land around 2–3x. The main change is that `A(λ)` is now assembled on a sparsity
pattern computed once per constraint set, so each dual evaluation writes into a fixed
data array instead of summing the constraint matrices one at a time and merging their
index structures: 5–58x on assembly alone, which had grown to be the largest cost in
the solve. Cholesky factorizations are also reused across the line search rather than
recomputed, the PSD-boundary eigensolve reuses the factorization it already has instead
of building its own, and several smaller per-call costs are gone. Nothing about the
bounds changed: at fixed multipliers the dual value, gradient and Hessian agree with
0.2.1 to 1e-11 or better.

Two other things worth knowing:

- **Bug fix:** with more than one PSD-boundary penalty vector live, the penalty gradient
  and Hessian were computed from only the last one, so Newton and GCD runs were stepping
  on wrong second derivatives (affecting convergence but not invalidating existing limits).
- **New:** GCD can orthogonalize its constraints in the Hilbert–Schmidt metric
  (`ortho_metric="hilbert_schmidt"`, now the default), which converges better per
  iteration than the previous Euclidean normalization.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-07-22

Packaging fix. The 0.2.0 wheel accidentally shipped only the top-level package,
so `import dolphindes.photonics` (and the other subpackages) failed on a fresh
install. 0.2.0 has been yanked from PyPI — use 0.2.1.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-22

A year of work on top of the first public release. The highlights:

- **Generalized constraints.** The QCQP core was rebuilt around a shared-projection
  formulation with a proper off-diagonal projector framework, so you're no longer
  limited to the few constraint types the original code handled.
- **Differentiable solver.** New optional JAX bridge (`pip install dolphindes[jax]`)
  lets you differentiate through the FDFD solve.
- **Polar FDFD solver.** Solve on polar grids, with rotational/mirror symmetry,
  non-zero inner boundaries, and inner PML.
- **Nicer setup.** Geometry and optimizer settings are now dataclasses
  (`CartesianFDFDGeometry`, `PolarFDFDGeometry`, `OptimizationHyperparameters`, …)
  instead of loose arguments and dicts.
- **Input validation** with clearer errors, and adjoint gradients for `Photonics_TM_FDFD`.
- **Docs, typing, CI.** Sphinx docs on Read the Docs, a typed package (`py.typed`),
  and ruff/mypy/pytest running on every PR.

## [0.1.0] — 2025-07-22

First public release: performance bounds for 2D photonics problems with Ez (TM)
polarization.
