    "## Custom Maxwell Solvers\n",
    "Our FDFD Maxwell solver is great for simple tasks. The solver does not need to be fast: to compute limits, you only need to compute the inverse of the background Green's function mapping currents in the design region to fields in the design region, *once*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Still, if you want to slot in your own Maxwell solver, this tutorial will cover how to do so. This might help have better numerical consistency between the limits and your own inverse designs, or allow you to calculate limits for more complex systems."
