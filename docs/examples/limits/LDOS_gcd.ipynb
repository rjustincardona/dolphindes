    "# Computing Bounds on the Local Density of States using General Constraint Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the use of general constraint descent (GCD) for evaluating dual bounds, using local density of states (LDOS) maximization as the example problem. For more background on LDOS optimization and bounds, see LDOS.ipynb. \n",
    "\n",
    "The tightest dual bound for a photonic inverse design problem is found by imposing all possible local power conservation constraints in the corresponding field optimization QCQP. Unfortunately, due to the large number of constraints, evaluating this tightest dual bound can be extremely expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of GCD is to approximate the tightest dual bound with a smaller, more manageable number of constraints. This is pursued by iteratively adding new constraints to the QCQP to tighten the bounds, and merging old constraints to keep the total number of constraints fixed. \n",
    "\n",
    "GCD is implemented for all shared projection QCQPs in dolphindes, and this notebook demonstrates the high-level use of the available GCD functionality. For more mathematical details on GCD, see Appendix B of https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10469."
